  Cycle through the world array and assign each colour (r, g, b, d) to map_colours.txt and
  the tile values to map_tiles.txt. Each value must have a tab after it.
  
  Will a tab at the end impact how the array is parsed when starting the game?
  
  interactive_level.txt likely won't need interacting with. An easy way to build/edit this 
  file? Probably a seperate smaller program.
